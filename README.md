# Pong clone
A Pong clone made with Unity.

Project is available on [itch.io](https://stijn301.itch.io/pong-clone).

### Why

A small project I made for learning, 

This game is the first in a set of smaller games I will be making, it was made in less than about 12 hours, split over 2 days.
The idea is to build something within 24 or 48 hours,
iterating quickly & just moving on to the next project is really helpful to both try out & get familiar with new concepts, and to prevent getting stuck in a large messy project, or overthinking all sorts of design choices.
Knowing that you'll move on from a project in 1 / 2 days anyway makes it a lot easier to just focus on learning, so ye I'll be doing more of this!
Though for slightly larger games I'm fine with it taking like 5 days, more than that is too much though.
